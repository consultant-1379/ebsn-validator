/**
 * Description: Generated for Secondary Node side of NR-DC to monitor Secondary Node Modification procedures. Modification can be initiated by one of the following nodes:
  - By Master Node, with XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST message.
  - By Secondary Node, with XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUIRED message.
Contains information about modification type and result.

When initiated for Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure, the following start and stop triggers apply:
   Start trigger is reception of XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST.
   If procedure is successful, stop trigger is reception of XnAP S-NODE RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message followed by the following messages:
         - E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE
         - F1AP UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE
   If procedure is aborted, stop trigger is reception of XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE.
   If procedure fails, stop trigger is one of the following options:
         - Transmission of XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST REJECT
         - Transmission of XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUIRED
         - XnAP S-NODE RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE not received

When initiated for Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure, the following start and stop triggers apply:
   Start trigger is reception of E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUIRED.
   If procedure is successful, stop trigger is transmission of E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION CONFIRM (Cell Group Information IE not present).
   If procedure is aborted, stop trigger is one of the following options:
         - Reception of XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST
         - Reception of XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE
         - Reception of XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUEST
           - Followed by transmission of E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION CONFIRM (Cell Group Information IE present)
   If procedure fails, stop trigger is one of the following options:
         - Consistency check failure of E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUIRED
         - Reception of XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REFUSE
         - Consistency check failure of XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION CONFIRM
         - Expiration of timer tXnDcOverall
           - Followed by transmission of E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION CONFIRM (Cell Group Information IE present)
