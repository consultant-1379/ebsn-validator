/**
 * Description: Generated for Master Node side of NR-DC to monitor Secondary Node Release procedure. Release can be initiated by one of the following nodes:
  - By Master Node, with XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE or XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUEST message.
  - By Secondary Node, with XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUIRED message.
Contains information about request and result.

When initiated by transmission of XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE message with no previous XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUEST message, trigger is XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE message.
No start or stop, event is triggered immediately.

When initiated by transmission of XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUEST message, following start and stop triggers apply:
   Start trigger is one of the following messages:
         - E1AP BEARER CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST, sent before transmission of XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUEST.
         - E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST, sent before transmission of XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUEST.
   Stop trigger is reception of one of the following messages in case of success:
         - NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM.
         - F1AP UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE for reconfiguration confirm indicator.
         - E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE after reception of XnAP SN STATUS TRANSFER.
   Stop trigger is one of the following messages in case of failure:
         - Transmission of NGAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST.
         - Reception of XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REJECT.
         - XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE not received.
         - NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM not received.
         - XnAP SN STATUS TRANSFER not received for RLC AM.
When initiated by reception of XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUIRED message, following start and stop triggers apply:
   Start trigger is reception of XnAP S-NODE RELEASE REQUIRED message.
   Stop trigger is reception of the following messages in case of success:
         - NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM.
         - F1AP UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE for RCI.
         - E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE after reception of XnAP SN STATUS TRANSFER.
   Stop trigger is one of the following procedures in case of failure:
         - Transmission of NGAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST.
         - NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM not received.
         - F1AP UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE for RCI not received.
         - E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE not received after XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE.
